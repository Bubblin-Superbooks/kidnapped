Him he prevailed on to take me, for he was one of his flock; and in this way I saved a long day&rsquo;s travel and the price of the two public ferries I must otherwise have passed.</p><p>It was near noon before we set out; a dark day with clouds, and the sun shining upon little patches. The sea was here very deep and still, and had scarce a wave upon it; so that I must put the water to my lips before I could believe it to be truly salt. The mountains on either side were high, rough and barren, very black and gloomy in the shadow of the clouds, but all silver-laced with little watercourses where the sun shone upon them. It seemed a hard country, this of Appin, for people to care as much about as Alan did.</p></div> </div>
