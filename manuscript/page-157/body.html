I offered him a share, as was much the custom in those days; but he was far too great a man to sit with such poor customers as Ransome and myself, and he was leaving the room, when I called him back to ask if he knew Mr. Rankeillor.</p><p>&ldquo;Hoot, ay,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and a very honest man. And, O, by-the-by,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;was it you that came in with Ebenezer?&rdquo; And when I had told him yes, &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be no friend of his?&rdquo; he asked, meaning, in the Scottish way, that I would be no relative.</p></div> </div>
