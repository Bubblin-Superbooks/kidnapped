<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Was this the palace I had been coming to? Was it within these walls that I was to seek new friends and begin great fortunes? Why, in my father&rsquo;s house on Essen-Waterside, the fire and the bright lights would show a mile away, and the door open to a beggar&rsquo;s knock!</p><p>I came forward cautiously, and giving ear as I came, heard some one rattling with dishes, and a little dry, eager cough that came in fits; but there was no sound of speech, and not a dog barked.</p><p>The door, as well as I could see it in the dim light, was a great piece of wood all studded with nails; and I lifted my hand with a faint heart under my jacket, and knocked once. Then I stood and waited. The house had fallen into a dead silence; a whole minute passed away, and nothing stirred but the bats overhead. I knocked again, and hearkened again.</p></div> </div>
