<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Of all deaths, I would truly like least to die by the gallows; and the picture of that uncanny instrument came into my head with extraordinary clearness (as I had once seen it engraved at the top of a pedlar&rsquo;s ballad) and took away my appetite for courts of justice.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll chance it, Alan,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But mind you,&rdquo; said Alan, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no small thing. Ye maun lie bare and hard, and brook many an empty belly. Your bed shall be the moorcock&rsquo;s, and your life shall be like the hunted deer&rsquo;s, and ye shall sleep with your hand upon your weapons. Ay, man, ye shall taigle many a weary foot, or we get clear! I tell ye this at the start, for it&rsquo;s a life that I ken well. But if ye ask what other chance ye have, I answer: Nane. Either take to the heather with me, or else hang.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
