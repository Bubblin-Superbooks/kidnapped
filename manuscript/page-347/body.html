<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As soon as the day began to break I put on my shoes and climbed a hill&mdash;the ruggedest scramble I ever undertook&mdash;falling, the whole way, between big blocks of granite, or leaping from one to another. When I got to the top the dawn was come. There was no sign of the brig, which must have lifted from the reef and sunk. The boat, too, was nowhere to be seen. There was never a sail upon the ocean; and in what I could see of the land was neither house nor man.</p><p>I was afraid to think what had befallen my shipmates, and afraid to look longer at so empty a scene. What with my wet clothes and weariness, and my belly that now began to ache with hunger, I had enough to trouble me without that.</p></div> </div>
