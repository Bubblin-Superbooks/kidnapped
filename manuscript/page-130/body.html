He gave me good-morning civilly; and I gave the same to him, smiling down upon him, from the heights of my sufficiency.

I took you for a good man, or no worse than others at the least. It seems we were both wrong. What cause you have to fear me, to cheat me, and to attempt my life&mdash;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
