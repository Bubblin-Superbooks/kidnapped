But you are to remember, since I have been in the Highlands, I have seen a good many of those that bear it; and the best I can say of them is this, that they would be none the worse of washing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know that you insult me?&rdquo; said Alan, very low.</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry for that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for I am not done; and if you distaste the sermon, I doubt the pirliecue* will please you as little. You have been chased in the field by the grown men of my party; it seems a poor kind of pleasure to out-face a boy. Both the Campbells and the Whigs have beaten you; you have run before them like a hare. It behoves you to speak of them as of your betters.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
