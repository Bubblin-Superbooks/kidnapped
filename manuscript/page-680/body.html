The moon was not yet up when we came there; a few lights shone along the front of the fortress, and lower down a few lighted windows in the town; but it was all mighty still, and there seemed to be no guard upon the passage.</p><p>I was for pushing straight across; but Alan was more wary.</p><p>&ldquo;It looks unco&rsquo; quiet,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but for all that we&rsquo;ll lie down here cannily behind a dyke, and make sure.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
