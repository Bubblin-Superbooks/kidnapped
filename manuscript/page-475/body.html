But I thought it would be better no to wait. Ye see there&rsquo;s a strip of Campbells in that end of Mull, which is no good company for a gentleman like me. If it hadnae been for that I would have waited and looked for ye mysel&rsquo;, let alone giving a hand to the little man.&rdquo; (It was droll how Alan dwelt on Mr. Riach&rsquo;s stature, for, to say the truth, the one was not much smaller than the other.) &ldquo;So,&rdquo; says he, continuing, &ldquo;I set my best foot forward, and whenever I met in with any one I cried out there was a wreck ashore. Man, they didnae stop to fash with me! Ye should have seen them linking for the beach! And when they got there they found they had had the pleasure of a run, which is aye good for a Campbell.</p></div> </div>
