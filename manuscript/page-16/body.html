Dramatic composition was not what my husband preferred, but the torrent of Mr. Henley&rsquo;s enthusiasm swept him off his feet. However, after several plays had been finished, and his health seriously impaired by his endeavours to keep up with Mr. Henley, play writing was abandoned forever, and my husband returned to his legitimate vocation. Having added one of the titles, The Hanging Judge, to the list of projected plays, now thrown aside, and emboldened by my husband&rsquo;s offer to give me any help needed, I concluded to try and write it myself.</p><p>As I wanted a trial scene in the Old Bailey, I chose the period of 1700 for my purpose;</p></div> </div>
