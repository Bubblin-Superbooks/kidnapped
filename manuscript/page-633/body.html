<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thinks I to myself, &ldquo;I have a better taunt in readiness; when I lie down and die, you will feel it like a buffet in your face; ah, what a revenge! ah, how you will regret your ingratitude and cruelty!&rdquo;</p><p>All the while, I was growing worse and worse.

Flushes of heat went over me, and then spasms of shuddering. The stitch in my side was hardly bearable. At last I began to feel that I could trail myself no farther: and with that, there came on me all at once the wish to have it out with Alan, let my anger blaze, and be done with my life in a more sudden manner. He had just called me &ldquo;Whig.&rdquo; I stopped.</p></div> </div>
