<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Uncle Ebenezer went and looked out of the window for awhile. I could see him all trembling and twitching, like a man with palsy. But when he turned round, he had a smile upon his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we must bear and forbear. I&rsquo;ll no go; that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s to be said of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle Ebenezer,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I can make nothing out of this. You use me like a thief; you hate to have me in this house; you let me see it, every word and every minute: it&rsquo;s not possible that you can like me; and as for me, I&rsquo;ve spoken to you as I never thought to speak to any man. Why do you seek to keep me, then? Let me gang back&mdash;let me gang back to the friends I have, and that like me!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
