<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I never knew, sir, till you told it me yourself, that he had any brother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dear me, dear me!&rdquo; said Ebenezer. &ldquo;Nor yet of Shaws, I dare say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not so much as the name, sir,&rdquo; said I.</p><p>&ldquo;To think o&rsquo; that!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;A strange nature of a man!&rdquo; For all that, he seemed singularly satisfied, but whether with himself, or me, or with this conduct of my father&rsquo;s, was more than I could read. Certainly, however, he seemed to be outgrowing that distaste, or ill-will, that he had conceived at first against my person; for presently he jumped up, came across the room behind me, and hit me a smack upon the shoulder. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll agree fine yet!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as glad I let you in. And now come awa&rsquo; to your bed.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
