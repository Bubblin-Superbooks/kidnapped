<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &ldquo;Your father was very fond of his meat, I mind; he was a hearty, if not a great eater; but as for me, I could never do mair than pyke at food.&rdquo; He took a pull at the small beer, which probably reminded him of hospitable duties, for his next speech ran thus: &ldquo;If ye&rsquo;re dry ye&rsquo;ll find water behind the door.&rdquo;</p><p>To this I returned no answer, standing stiffly on my two feet, and looking down upon my uncle with a mighty angry heart. He, on his part, continued to eat like a man under some pressure of time, and to throw out little darting glances now at my shoes and now at my home-spun stockings. Once only, when he had ventured to look a little higher, our eyes met; and no thief taken with a hand in a man&rsquo;s pocket could have shown more lively signals of distress.</p></div> </div>
