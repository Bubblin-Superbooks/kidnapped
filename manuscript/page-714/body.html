At first I proposed I should give him for a signal the &ldquo;Bonnie House of Airlie,&rdquo; which was a favourite of mine; but he objected that as the piece was very commonly known, any ploughman might whistle it by accident; and taught me instead a little fragment of a Highland air, which has run in my head from that day to this, and will likely run in my head when I lie dying.
