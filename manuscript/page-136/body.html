Now, if you and me was to walk over with yon lad, I could see the captain at the Hawes, or maybe on board the Covenant if there was papers to be signed; and so far from a loss of time, we can jog on to the lawyer, Mr. Rankeillor&rsquo;s. After a&rsquo; that&rsquo;s come and gone, ye would be swier* to believe me upon my naked word; but ye&rsquo;ll believe Rankeillor. He&rsquo;s factor to half the gentry in these parts; an auld man, forby: highly respeckit, and he kenned your father.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
