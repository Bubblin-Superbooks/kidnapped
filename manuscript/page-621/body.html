<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I will only say this to ye, David,&rdquo; said Alan, very quietly, &ldquo;that I have long been owing ye my life, and now I owe ye money. Ye should try to make that burden light for me.&rdquo;</p><p>This ought to have touched me, and in a manner it did, but the wrong manner. I felt I was behaving badly; and was now not only angry with Alan, but angry with myself in the bargain; and it made me the more cruel.</p><p>&ldquo;You asked me to speak,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Well, then, I will. You own yourself that you have done me a disservice; I have had to swallow an affront: I have never reproached you, I never named the thing till you did. And now you blame me,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;because I cannae laugh and sing as if I was glad to be affronted.</p></div> </div>
