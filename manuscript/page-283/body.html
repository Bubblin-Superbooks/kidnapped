There&rsquo;s none of the rest of us acquaint with this coast, sir; and it&rsquo;s one very dangerous to ships.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I give ye your choice,&rdquo; says Alan. &ldquo;Set me on dry ground in Appin, or Ardgour, or in Morven, or Arisaig, or Morar; or, in brief, where ye please, within thirty miles of my own country; except in a country of the Campbells. That&rsquo;s a broad target. If ye miss that, ye must be as feckless at the sailoring as I have found ye at the fighting.</p></div> </div>
