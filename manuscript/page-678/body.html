We passed the Hieland Line in the first hour; and now if we could but pass yon crooked water, we might cast our bonnets in the air.&rdquo;</p><p>In Allan Water, near by where it falls into the Forth, we found a little sandy islet, overgrown with burdock, butterbur and the like low plants, that would just cover us if we lay flat.</p></div> </div>
