<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One day, while my husband was busily at work, I sat beside him reading an old cookery book called The Compleat Housewife: or Accomplish&rsquo;d Gentlewoman&rsquo;s Companion. In the midst of receipts for &ldquo;Rabbits, and Chickens mumbled, Pickled Samphire, Skirret Pye, Baked Tansy,&rdquo; and other forgotten delicacies, there were directions for the preparation of several lotions for the preservation of beauty. One of these was so charming that I interrupted my husband to read it aloud. &ldquo;Just what I wanted!&rdquo; he exclaimed; and the receipt for the &ldquo;Lily of the Valley Water&rdquo; was instantly incorporated into Kidnapped.</p><p>F.
