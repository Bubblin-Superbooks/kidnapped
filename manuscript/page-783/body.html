That will do excellently well,&rdquo; said the lawyer, stepping forward; and then mighty civilly, &ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>And, &ldquo;Good-evening, Uncle Ebenezer,&rdquo; said I.</p><p>And, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a braw nicht, Mr. Balfour,&rdquo; added Torrance.</p><p>Never a word said my uncle, neither black nor white; but just sat where he was on the top door-step and stared upon us like a man turned to stone. Alan filched away his blunderbuss; and the lawyer, taking him by the arm, plucked him up from the doorstep, led him into the kitchen, whither we all followed, and set him down in a chair beside the hearth, where the fire was out and only a rush-light burning.</p></div> </div>
