But so far, I may tell you, this agrees pretty exactly with other informations that I hold. But you say you were kidnapped; in what sense?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the plain meaning of the word, sir,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I was on my way to your house, when I was trepanned on board the brig, cruelly struck down, thrown below, and knew no more of anything till we were far at sea. I was destined for the plantations; a fate that, in God&rsquo;s providence, I have escaped.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
