<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The tediousness and pain of these hours upon the rock grew only the greater as the day went on; the rock getting still the hotter and the sun fiercer. There were giddiness, and sickness, and sharp pangs like rheumatism, to be supported. I minded then, and have often minded since, on the lines in our Scotch psalm:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The moon by night thee shall not smite, Nor yet the sun by day;&rdquo;</p><p>and indeed it was only by God&rsquo;s blessing that we were neither of us sun-smitten.</p><p>At last, about two, it was beyond men&rsquo;s bearing, and there was now temptation to resist, as well as pain to thole. For the sun being now got a little into the west, there came a patch of shade on the east side of our rock, which was the side sheltered from the soldiers.</p></div> </div>
