This cross is something in the nature of the crosstarrie, or fiery cross, which is the signal of gathering in our clans; yet he will know well enough the clan is not to rise, for there it is standing in his window, and no word with it. So he will say to himsel&rsquo;, THE CLAN IS NOT TO RISE, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING. Then he will see my button, and that was Duncan Stewart&rsquo;s. And then he will say to himsel&rsquo;, THE SON OF DUNCAN IS IN THE HEATHER, AND HAS NEED OF ME.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
