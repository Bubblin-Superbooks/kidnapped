<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I have fished a water with a sentry on the other side of the brae, and killed a fine trout; and I have sat in a heather bush within six feet of another, and learned a real bonny tune from his whistling. This was it,&rdquo; said he, and whistled me the air.</p><p>&ldquo;And then, besides,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no sae bad now as it was in forty-six. The Hielands are what they call pacified. Small wonder, with never a gun or a sword left from Cantyre to Cape Wrath, but what tenty* folk have hidden in their thatch! But what I would like to ken, David, is just how long? Not long, ye would think, with men like Ardshiel in exile and men like the Red Fox sitting birling the wine and oppressing the poor at home. But it&rsquo;s a kittle thing to decide what folk&rsquo;ll bear, and what they will not.</p></div> </div>
