In the year &lsquo;45, my brother raised a part of the &lsquo;Gregara&rsquo; and marched six companies to strike a stroke for the good side; and the surgeon that marched with our clan and cured my brother&rsquo;s leg when it was broken in the brush at Preston Pans, was a gentleman of the same name precisely as yourself. He was brother to Balfour of Baith; and if you are in any reasonable degree of nearness one of that gentleman&rsquo;s kin, I have come to put myself and my people at your command.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
