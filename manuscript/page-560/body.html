In front of us there lay a piece of low, broken, desert land, which we must now cross. The sun was not long up, and shone straight in our eyes; a little, thin mist went up from the face of the moorland like a smoke; so that (as Alan said) there might have been twenty squadron of dragoons there and we none the wiser.</p><p>We sat down, therefore, in a howe of the hill-side till the mist should have risen, and made ourselves a dish of drammach, and held a council of war.</p><p>&ldquo;David,&rdquo; said Alan, &ldquo;this is the kittle bit. Shall we lie here till it comes night, or shall we risk it, and stave on ahead?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
