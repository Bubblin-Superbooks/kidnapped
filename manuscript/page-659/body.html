<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>You are to remember that I knew no more of my descent than any cadger&rsquo;s dog; my uncle, to be sure, had prated of some of our high connections, but nothing to the present purpose; and there was nothing left me but that bitter disgrace of owning that I could not tell.</p><p>Robin told me shortly he was sorry he had put himself about, turned his back upon me without a sign of salutation, and as he went towards the door, I could hear him telling Duncan that I was &ldquo;only some kinless loon that didn&rsquo;t know his own father.&rdquo; Angry as I was at these words, and ashamed of my own ignorance, I could scarce keep from smiling that a man who was under the lash of the law (and was indeed hanged some three years later) should be so nice as to the descent of his acquaintances.</p></div> </div>
