<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We had one of the wounded men told off to keep a watch upon the seas and cry us warning. Well, we had the boat about ready to be launched, when this man sang out pretty shrill: &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, hold on!&rdquo; We knew by his tone that it was something more than ordinary; and sure enough, there followed a sea so huge that it lifted the brig right up and canted her over on her beam. Whether the cry came too late, or my hold was too weak, I know not; but at the sudden tilting of the ship I was cast clean over the bulwarks into the sea.</p><p>I went down, and drank my fill, and then came up, and got a blink of the moon, and then down again. They say a man sinks a third time for good.</p></div> </div>
