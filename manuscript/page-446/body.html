He gave me no salutation; indeed it was no time for civilities; only &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; says he, and set off running along the side of the mountain towards Balachulish; and I, like a sheep, to follow him.</p><p>Now we ran among the birches; now stooping behind low humps upon the mountain-side; now crawling on all fours among the heather. The pace was deadly: my heart seemed bursting against my ribs; and I had neither time to think nor breath to speak with.</p></div> </div>
