I&rsquo;ve brought a letter from old Heasyoasy to Mr. Belflower.&rdquo; He showed me a letter as he spoke. &ldquo;And I say, mate,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mortal hungry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;come into the house, and you shall have a bite if I go empty for it.&rdquo;</p><p>With that I brought him in and set him down to my own place, where he fell-to greedily on the remains of breakfast, winking to me between whiles, and making many faces, which I think the poor soul considered manly. Meanwhile, my uncle had read the letter and sat thinking; then, suddenly, he got to his feet with a great air of liveliness, and pulled me apart into the farthest corner of the room.</p></div> </div>
