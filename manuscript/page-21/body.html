<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A letter from James Stewart to Mr. John Macfarlane, introduced as evidence in the trial, says: &ldquo;There is one Alan Stewart, a distant friend of the late Ardshiel&rsquo;s, who is in the French service, and came over in March last, as he said to some, in order to settle at home; to others, that he was to go soon back; and was, as I hear, the day that the murder was committed, seen not far from the place where it happened, and is not now to be seen; by which it is believed he was the actor. He is a desperate foolish fellow; and if he is guilty, came to the country for that very purpose. He is a tall, pock-pitted lad, very black hair, and wore a blue coat and metal buttons, an old red vest, and breeches of the same colour.</p></div> </div>
