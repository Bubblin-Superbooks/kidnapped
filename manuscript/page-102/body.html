<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One thing I discovered, which put me in some doubt. This was an entry on the fly-leaf of a chap-book (one of Patrick Walker&rsquo;s) plainly written by my father&rsquo;s hand and thus conceived: &ldquo;To my brother Ebenezer on his fifth birthday.&rdquo; Now, what puzzled me was this: That, as my father was of course the younger brother, he must either have made some strange error, or he must have written, before he was yet five, an excellent, clear manly hand of writing.</p><p>I tried to get this out of my head; but though I took down many interesting authors, old and new, history, poetry, and story-book, this notion of my father&rsquo;s hand of writing stuck to me; and when at length I went back into the kitchen, and sat down once more to porridge and small beer, the first thing I said to Uncle Ebenezer was to ask him if my father had not been very quick at his book.</p></div> </div>
