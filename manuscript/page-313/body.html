Ardshiel was to starve: that was the thing he aimed at. And since them that fed him in his exile wouldnae be bought out&mdash;right or wrong, he would drive them out. Therefore he sent for lawyers, and papers, and red-coats to stand at his back. And the kindly folk of that country must all pack and tramp, every father&rsquo;s son out of his father&rsquo;s house, and out of the place where he was bred and fed, and played when he was a callant. And who are to succeed them? Bare-leggit beggars! King George is to whistle for his rents; he maun dow with less; he can spread his butter thinner: what cares Red Colin? If he can hurt Ardshiel, he has his wish; if he can pluck the meat from my chieftain&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
