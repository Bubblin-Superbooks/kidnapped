But would it not be simpler for you to write him a few words in black and white?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And that is an excellent observe, Mr. Balfour of Shaws,&rdquo; says Alan, drolling with me; &ldquo;and it would certainly be much simpler for me to write to him, but it would be a sore job for John Breck to read it. He would have to go to the school for two-three years; and it&rsquo;s possible we might be wearied waiting on him.&rdquo;</p><p>So that night Alan carried down his fiery cross and set it in the bouman&rsquo;s window. He was troubled when he came back; for the dogs had barked and the folk run out from their houses; and he thought he had heard a clatter of arms and seen a red-coat come to one of the doors.</p></div> </div>
