Nor was this all; for suppose I was arrested when I was alone, there was little against me; but suppose I was taken in company with the reputed murderer, my case would begin to be grave. For generosity&rsquo;s sake I dare not speak my mind upon this head; but I thought of it none the less.</p><p>I thought of it all the more, too, when the bouman brought out a green purse with four guineas in gold, and the best part of another in small change. True, it was more than I had. But then Alan, with less than five guineas, had to get as far as France; I, with my less than two, not beyond Queensferry; so that taking things in their proportion, Alan&rsquo;s society was not only a peril to my life, but a burden on my purse.</p></div> </div>
