We&rsquo;re all three innocent, and that seems to be what&rsquo;s wanted. But at least, sir,&rdquo; said I to James, recovering from my little fit of annoyance, &ldquo;I am Alan&rsquo;s friend, and if I can be helpful to friends of his, I will not stumble at the risk.&rdquo;</p><p>I thought it best to put a fair face on my consent, for I saw Alan troubled; and, besides (thinks I to myself), as soon as my back is turned, they will paper me, as they call it, whether I consent or not. But in this I saw I was wrong; for I had no sooner said the words, than Mrs. Stewart leaped out of her chair, came running over to us, and wept first upon my neck and then on Alan&rsquo;s, blessing God for our goodness to her family.</p></div> </div>
