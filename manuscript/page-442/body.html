He was a big man, in a black coat, with metal buttons, and carried a long fowling-piece.</p><p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I see him!&rdquo;</p><p>At that the murderer gave a little, quick look over his shoulder, and began to run. The next moment he was lost in a fringe of birches; then he came out again on the upper side, where I could see him climbing like a jackanapes, for that part was again very steep; and then he dipped behind a shoulder, and I saw him no more.</p></div> </div>
