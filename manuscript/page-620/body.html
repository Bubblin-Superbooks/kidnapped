<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This pierced me like a sword, and seemed to lay bare my private disloyalty.</p><p>&ldquo;Alan Breck!&rdquo; I cried; and then: &ldquo;Do you think I am one to turn my back on you in your chief need? You dursn&rsquo;t say it to my face. My whole conduct&rsquo;s there to give the lie to it. It&rsquo;s true, I fell asleep upon the muir; but that was from weariness, and you do wrong to cast it up to me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which is what I never did,&rdquo; said Alan.</p><p>&ldquo;But aside from that,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;what have I done that you should even me to dogs by such a supposition? I never yet failed a friend, and it&rsquo;s not likely I&rsquo;ll begin with you. There are things between us that I can never forget, even if you can.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
