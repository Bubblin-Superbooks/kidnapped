<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>My husband was always interested in this period of his country&rsquo;s history, and had already the intention of writing a story that should turn on the Appin murder. The tale was to be of a boy, David Balfour, supposed to belong to my husband&rsquo;s own family, who should travel in Scotland as though it were a foreign country, meeting with various adventures and misadventures by the way. From the trial of James Stewart my husband gleaned much valuable material for his novel, the most important being the character of Alan Breck. Aside from having described him as &ldquo;smallish in stature,&rdquo; my husband seems to have taken Alan Breck&rsquo;s personal appearance, even to his clothing, from the book.</p></div> </div>
