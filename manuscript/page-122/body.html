It is true I felt some pity for a man that looked so sick, but I was full besides of righteous anger; and I numbered over before him the points on which I wanted explanation: why he lied to me at every word; why he feared that I should leave him; why he disliked it to be hinted that he and my father were twins&mdash;&ldquo;Is that because it is true?&rdquo; I asked; why he had given me money to which I was convinced I had no claim; and, last of all, why he had tried to kill me.</p></div> </div>
