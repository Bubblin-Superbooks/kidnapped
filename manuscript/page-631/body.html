<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The streams were full, of course, and still made a great noise among the hills; but I observed that Alan thought no more upon the Kelpie, and was in high good spirits. As for me, the change of weather came too late; I had lain in the mire so long that (as the Bible has it) my very clothes &ldquo;abhorred me.&rdquo; I was dead weary, deadly sick and full of pains and shiverings; the chill of the wind went through me, and the sound of it confused my ears. In this poor state I had to bear from my companion something in the nature of a persecution. He spoke a good deal, and never without a taunt. &ldquo;Whig&rdquo; was the best name he had to give me. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a dub for ye to jump, my Whiggie! I ken you&rsquo;re a fine jumper!&rdquo; And so on; all the time with a gibing voice and face.</p></div> </div>
