A little after we had started, the sun shone upon a little moving clump of scarlet close in along the water-side to the north. It was much of the same red as soldiers&rsquo; coats; every now and then, too, there came little sparks and lightnings, as though the sun had struck upon bright steel.</p><p>I asked my boatman what it should be, and he answered he supposed it was some of the red soldiers coming from Fort William into Appin, against the poor tenantry of the country. Well, it was a sad sight to me; and whether it was because of my thoughts of Alan, or from something prophetic in my bosom, although this was but the second time I had seen King George&rsquo;s troops, I had no good will to them.</p></div> </div>
