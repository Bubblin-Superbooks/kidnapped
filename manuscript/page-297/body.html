I would hunt all of that name like blackcocks. If I lay dying, I would crawl upon my knees to my chamber window for a shot at one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, Alan,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;what ails ye at the Campbells?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;ye ken very well that I am an Appin Stewart, and the Campbells have long harried and wasted those of my name; ay, and got lands of us by treachery&mdash;but never with the sword,&rdquo; he cried loudly, and with the word brought down his fist upon the table.
