<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Alan clapped my shoulder, and said I was a brave lad and wanted nothing but a sleep.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the first watch,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve done well by me, David, first and last; and I wouldn&rsquo;t lose you for all Appin&mdash;no, nor for Breadalbane.&rdquo;</p><p>So I made up my bed on the floor; and he took the first spell, pistol in hand and sword on knee, three hours by the captain&rsquo;s watch upon the wall. Then he roused me up, and I took my turn of three hours; before the end of which it was broad day, and a very quiet morning, with a smooth, rolling sea that tossed the ship and made the blood run to and fro on the round-house floor, and a heavy rain that drummed upon the roof. All my watch there was nothing stirring; and by the banging of the helm, I knew they had even no one at the tiller.</p></div> </div>
