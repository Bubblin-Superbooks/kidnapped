The shores of Earraid were close in; I could see in the moonlight the dots of heather and the sparkling of the mica in the rocks.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought I to myself, &ldquo;if I cannot get as far as that, it&rsquo;s strange!&rdquo;</p><p>I had no skill of swimming, Essen Water being small in our neighbourhood; but when I laid hold upon the yard with both arms, and kicked out with both feet, I soon begun to find that I was moving.
