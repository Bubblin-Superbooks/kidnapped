<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Ay?&rdquo; said Mr. Campbell. &ldquo;Very well, Davie. Then it behoves me to tell your fortune; or so far as I may. When your mother was gone, and your father (the worthy, Christian man) began to sicken for his end, he gave me in charge a certain letter, which he said was your inheritance. &lsquo;So soon,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;as I am gone, and the house is redd up and the gear disposed of&rsquo; (all which, Davie, hath been done), &lsquo;give my boy this letter into his hand, and start him off to the house of Shaws, not far from Cramond. That is the place I came from,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and it&rsquo;s where it befits that my boy should return. He is a steady lad,&rsquo; your father said, &lsquo;and a canny goer; and I doubt not he will come safe, and be well lived where he goes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
