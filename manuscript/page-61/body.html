<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In those days folk still believed in witches and trembled at a curse; and this one, falling so pat, like a wayside omen, to arrest me ere I carried out my purpose, took the pith out of my legs.</p><p>I sat me down and stared at the house of Shaws. The more I looked, the pleasanter that country-side appeared; being all set with hawthorn bushes full of flowers; the fields dotted with sheep; a fine flight of rooks in the sky; and every sign of a kind soil and climate; and yet the barrack in the midst of it went sore against my fancy.</p><p>Country folk went by from the fields as I sat there on the side of the ditch, but I lacked the spirit to give them a good-e&rsquo;en.</p></div> </div>
