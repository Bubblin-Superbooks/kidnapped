<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, then, east, ye see, we have the muirs,&rdquo; said Alan. &ldquo;Once there, David, it&rsquo;s mere pitch-and-toss. Out on yon bald, naked, flat place, where can a body turn to? Let the red-coats come over a hill, they can spy you miles away; and the sorrow&rsquo;s in their horses&rsquo; heels, they would soon ride you down. It&rsquo;s no good place, David; and I&rsquo;m free to say, it&rsquo;s worse by daylight than by dark.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alan,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;hear my way of it. Appin&rsquo;s death for us; we have none too much money, nor yet meal; the longer they seek, the nearer they may guess where we are; it&rsquo;s all a risk; and I give my word to go ahead until we drop.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
