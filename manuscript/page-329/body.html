Well, well, it will be as it must.&rdquo;</p><p>As we got nearer to the turn of the land the reefs began to be sown here and there on our very path; and Mr. Riach sometimes cried down to us to change the course. Sometimes, indeed, none too soon; for one reef was so close on the brig&rsquo;s weather board that when a sea burst upon it the lighter sprays fell upon her deck and wetted us like rain.</p><p>The brightness of the night showed us these perils as clearly as by day, which was, perhaps, the more alarming. It showed me, too, the face of the captain as he stood by the steersman, now on one foot, now on the other, and sometimes blowing in his hands, but still listening and looking and as steady as steel.</p></div> </div>
